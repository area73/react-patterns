# REACT KITCHENSINK 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
and `yarn eject`  This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint,
 etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.
